## AWS Organizations Account Setup Instructions

1. **Sign in to the Organization Root Account**:
   - Before starting the setup, sign in to the AWS Management Console for the **root account** of your AWS organization: [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).   

2. **Obtain Your Root Accountâ€™s Organizational Unit (OU)**
   - Make sure to copy your root account's Organizational Unit (OU) ID. You can find this information by following the steps outlined in the [AWS Documentation on Navigating the Root and OU Hierarchy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/navigate_tree.html). 
   - This OU ID will need to be entered in the "OrganizationUnit" parameter during the stack deployment.

3. **Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**: Use the URL below to start the CloudFormation stack creation in the AWS console
