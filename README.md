Important note regarding permissions:

-	Explicit deny rules are in place for additional security

For cost and usage analysis, we'll need:
-	A ticket opened with AWS Support to share last 2 years of cost and usage reports. Once the AWS setup goes through I’ll share the details to share with AWS and Azure support folks.
-	A separate ticket with Azure Support to provide relevant information
Once the setup goes through I’ll share the details to share with AWS and Azure support folks.


More cloud providers and configurations will be supported soon, so stay tuned!
